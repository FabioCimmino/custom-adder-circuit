# custom-adder-circuit

The goal of this project is to design and build a synchronous circuit that allows you to add two numbers that will be provided by two synchronous registers.
The final result of the sum can be saved in a final register in different ways.
The circuit was made using the LTspice software.  
For more details on the design and implementation please see the pdf "LTSPICE project".
